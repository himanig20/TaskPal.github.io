# TaskPal 
Your one stop solution to hasslefree home maintainence needs

Many homeowners face challenges when it comes to finding reliable and skilled domestic workers for home maintenance and repairs. The process of searching for workers, scheduling appointments, and ensuring quality service can be time-consuming and frustrating.
Additionally, skilled workers may struggle to connect with clients and manage their schedules effectively. 

Skilled domestic workers face challenges in finding consistent work opportunities and establishing a reliable client base. Traditional methods of advertising services or relying on word-of-mouth referrals can be unreliable and time-consuming, leading to periods of financial instability and underutilization of their skills.

TaskPal aims to address these challenges by providing a convenient and efficient platform for homeowners to book skilled workers and for workers to find job opportunities.
